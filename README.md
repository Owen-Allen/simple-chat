# simple-chat

A simple terminal chat application built using sockets and C++.

Based on Hassan Yousuf's [Simple-Server-and-Chat-Program](https://github.com/hassanyousufx/Simple-Server-and-Chat-Program)

To run the application, first compile the server and client code using the following commands

```
g++ -std=c++20 server.cpp -o server
g++ -std=c++20 client.cpp -o client
```

Then, run the server and client code in seperate terminal windows. Make sure to run the server first.

```
./server
./client
```
